                    <h2>5. Performance and Delivery</h2>
                    <p>Delivery dates and deadlines are only binding if they have been expressly agreed upon in writing and confirmed by the Service Provider.</p>
                    <p>The Service Provider is entitled to provide partial services and to invoice them separately.</p>

                    <p>Upon full payment, the client receives the agreed usage rights. The scope of usage rights is determined by the respective project agreement.</p>
                    <p>The Service Provider retains the right to use the work results for self-promotion and portfolio purposes, unless otherwise agreed.</p>

                    <p>The liability for damages is limited to the typical, foreseeable damage at the time of contract conclusion, but at most to the amount of the contract value.</p>
